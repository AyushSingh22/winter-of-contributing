## Supervised Machine Learning


**In Simple words We use to learn how supervised learning works and how it can be used to build highly accurate machine learning models.**
Supervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is a subcategory of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms that to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. As input data is fed into the model, it adjusts its weights until the model has been fitted appropriately, which occurs as part of the cross validation process. Supervised learning helps organizations solve for a variety of real-world problems at scale, such as classifying spam in a separate folder from your inbox.

**How supervised learning works**
Supervised learning uses a training set to teach models to yield the desired output. This training dataset includes inputs and correct outputs, which allow the model to learn over time. The algorithm measures its accuracy through the loss function, adjusting until the error has been sufficiently minimized.

**Supervised learning can be separated into two types of problems when data mining—classification and regression:**

Classification uses an algorithm to accurately assign test data into specific categories. It recognizes specific entities within the dataset and attempts to draw some conclusions on how those entities should be labeled or defined. Common classification algorithms are linear classifiers, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, k-nearest neighbor, and random forest, which are described in more detail below.
Regression is used to understand the relationship between dependent and independent variables. It is commonly used to make projections, such as for sales revenue for a given business. Linear regression, logistical regression, and polynomial regression are popular regression algorithms.

**In supervised learning, there are two main identifiers you will see in machine learning:**

•	A categorical label has a discrete set of possible values. In a machine learning problem in which you want to identify the type of flower based on a picture, you would train your model using images that have been labelled with the categories of flower you would want to identify. Furthermore, when you work with categorical labels, you often carry out classification tasks*, which are part of the supervised learning family.
•	A continuous (regression) label does not have a discrete set of possible values, which often means you are working with numerical data. which means possibly an unlimited number of possibilities. In the snow cone sales example, we are trying to predict the number* of snow cones sold. Here, our label is a number that could, in theory, be any value.
